Hell Games Unlimited is a multiplayer fighting game that allows users
to fight against characters from various universes. These include, but are
not limited to anime, DC, Marvel, etc. I began this project as my first taste of 
programming in 2016, and have thus gutted it. I am now restructuring it for 
better usability, database capabilities, and the ability to choose between
various characters.
